### Projects

  - *Coarse-Graining for Coupled Oscillators*, research project at Los
    Alamos National Lab, *Summer 2018*

      - Extracted effective equations of motion for coarse-grained
        degrees of freedom describing synchronization of phase
        oscillators on a modular network. Used numerical and analytical
        results to deduce transitions between high- and low-dimensional

        Andrey Lokhov.

  - *A Dynamic Niche Model for the Spontaneous Emergence of Mutualistic
    Network Structures*, research project at UC Davis, *Fall 2017 -
    present*

      - Developed a theoretical model of the evolution of a mutualistic
        ecosystem, incorporating a feedback between the species
        abundances and the structure of the species-species interaction
        network. Reproduced network properties that are seen in the real
        world, and that were previously not explained by any single
        model. Work to be submitted with Weiran Cai and Raissa D’Souza.

        events in a stylized model of population dynamics on empirical
        mutualistic networks. Connected modularity and nestedness of
        interaction networks with the course of ecosystem-wide
        extinction. Work in progress with Raissa D’Souza and Weiran Cai.

  - *Entrainment of Coupled Oscillators*, research project at Los Alamos
    National Lab, *Summer 2016-2017*
