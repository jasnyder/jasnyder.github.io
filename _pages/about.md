I'm an applied mathematician interested broadly in collective behavior, especially as modeled by dynamical systems on networks. My current interest is in developing methods to infer low-dimensional equations of motion directly from data.

I earned my PhD in June 2019 from UC Davis, advised by [Raissa D'Souza](http://mae.engr.ucdavis.edu/dsouza/). You can read my dissertation [here](/files/dissertation.pdf).

Starting September 2019 I will be working as a postdoc in [Nathan Kutz](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/)'s group at the University of Washington. From September to December 2019, I will be in residence at [IPAM](http://ipam.ucla.edu) for their long program on [Machine Learning for Physics and the Physics of Learning](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/machine-learning-for-physics-and-the-physics-of-learning/).

## Bio
I grew up in the [suburbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_Grove) of [Philly](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jawn), then moved to [upstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York) New York for [college](http://www.pikappcastle.com/thehouse/) at RPI. After that I moved to sunny [Davis, California](https://daviswiki.org/) for grad school in [applied math](http://appliedmath.ucdavis.edu/).

I spent the summers 2016-2018 as an intern in the [Center for Nonlinear Studies](cnls.lanl.gov) at Los Alamos National Lab, working primarily with [Anatoly Zlotnik](azlotnik.github.io), [Andrey Lokhov](http://lptms.u-psud.fr/andrey-lokhov/), [Aric Habgerg](http://aric.hagberg.org/), and [Andrew Sornborger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewsornborger/).

In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking, cooking, listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/album/3cADvHRdKniF9ELCn1zbGH), and novice [flameworking](/images/pendant.jpg).
