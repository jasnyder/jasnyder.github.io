Numerical simulations form a backbone of modern science. We investigate the following question: given a simulation of some dynamical process, does there exist a good lower-dimensional representation? If so, finding such a representation may offer both computational speedup and fundamental insight into the dynamics of interest. To approach this question in the abstract, we infer coarse-grained equations of motion that describe a heterogeneous population of oscillators with a modular coupling structure. We choose this system because it is known to exhibit a transition from high- to low-dimensional behavior, and that low-dimensional behavior is well-described by equations of a known form. We conclude by exploring ways to move forward by systematically discarding several of the simplifying assumptions at play.
