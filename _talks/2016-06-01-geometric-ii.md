For decades, scientists across many disciplines, from biology to physics to mathematics, have been fascinated by emergent phenomena - complex behavior that arises from the interaction of many simple units. One approach to uncovering the underlying mechanisms behind emergence comes from information theory, which aims to quantitatively describe coordination between units in terms of production, transmission, and processing of information. In this talk, I will present a unified geometric interpretation of several different information measures intended to quantify causally-relevant information flow among components of a stochastic process, and calculate them on multi-layered primate social network data recorded by the [McCowan lab](https://bmccowanlab.com/) at the California National Primate Research Center ([CNPRC](https://cnprc.ucdavis.edu/)).
