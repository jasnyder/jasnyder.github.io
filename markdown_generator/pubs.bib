abstract = {Mutualistic interactions are vital constituents of ecological and socio-economic systems. Empirical studies have found that the patterns of reciprocal relations among the participants often shows the salient features of being simultaneously nested and modular. Whether and how these two structural properties of mutualistic networks can emerge out of a common mechanism however remains unclear. We propose a unified dynamic model based on the adaptation of niche relations that gives rise to both structural features. We apply Hutchinson's concept of niche interaction to networked cooperative species. Their niche relation evolves under the assumption of fitness maximization. Modularity and nestedness emerge concurrently through the accumulated local advantages in the structural and demographic distribution. A rich ensemble of key dynamical behaviors are unveiled in the dynamical framework. We demonstrate that mutualism can exhibit either a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the evolved network, which undergoes a drastic transition with the overall competition level. Most strikingly, the adaptive network may exhibit a profound nature of history-dependency in response to environmental changes, allowing it to be found in alternative stable structures. The adaptive nature of niche interactions, as captured in our framework, can underlie a broad class of ecological relations and also socio-economic networks that engage in bipartite cooperation.},

@article{Cantwell2019,
abstract = {Network data sets are often constructed by some kind of thresholding procedure. The resulting networks frequently possess properties such as heavy-tailed degree distributions, clustering, large connected components and short average shortest path lengths. These properties are considered typical of complex networks and appear in many contexts, prompting consideration of their universality. Here we introduce a simple generative model for continuous valued relational data and study the network ensemble obtained by thresholding it. We find that some, but not all, of the properties associated with complex networks can be seen after thresholding, even though the underlying data is not "complex". In particular, we observe heavy-tailed degree distributions, large numbers of triangles, and short path lengths, while we do not observe non-vanishing clustering or community structure.},

@article{Snyder2020,
abstract = {Many large scale phenomena, such as rapid changes in public opinion and the outbreak of disease epidemics, can be fruitfully modeled as cascades of activation on networks. This provides understanding of how various connectivity patterns among agents can influence the eventual extent of a cascade. We consider cascading dynamics on modular, degree-heterogeneous networks, as such features are observed in many real-world networks, and consider specifically the impact of the seeding strategy. We derive an analytic set of equations for the system by introducing a reduced description that extends a method developed by Gleeson that lets us accurately capture different seeding strategies using only one dynamical variable per module, namely the conditional exposure probability. We establish that activating the highest-degree nodes rather than random selection is more effective at growing a cascade locally, while the ability of a cascade to fully activate other modules is determined by the extent of large-scale interconnection between modules and is independent of how seed nodes are selected.},
