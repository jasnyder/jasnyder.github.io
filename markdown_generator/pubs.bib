abstract = {Network data sets are often constructed by some kind of thresholding procedure. The resulting networks frequently possess properties such as heavy-tailed degree distributions, clustering, large connected components and short average shortest path lengths. These properties are considered typical of complex networks and appear in many contexts, prompting consideration of their universality. Here we introduce a simple generative model for continuous valued relational data and study the network ensemble obtained by thresholding it. We find that some, but not all, of the properties associated with complex networks can be seen after thresholding, even though the underlying data is not "complex". In particular, we observe heavy-tailed degree distributions, large numbers of triangles, and short path lengths, while we do not observe non-vanishing clustering or community structure.},

@article{Snyder2020,
abstract = {Many large scale phenomena, such as rapid changes in public opinion and the outbreak of disease epidemics, can be fruitfully modeled as cascades of activation on networks. This provides understanding of how various connectivity patterns among agents can influence the eventual extent of a cascade. We consider cascading dynamics on modular, degree-heterogeneous networks, as such features are observed in many real-world networks, and consider specifically the impact of the seeding strategy. We derive an analytic set of equations for the system by introducing a reduced description that extends a method developed by Gleeson that lets us accurately capture different seeding strategies using only one dynamical variable per module, namely the conditional exposure probability. We establish that activating the highest-degree nodes rather than random selection is more effective at growing a cascade locally, while the ability of a cascade to fully activate other modules is determined by the extent of large-scale interconnection between modules and is independent of how seed nodes are selected.},

@article{Cai2020,
abstract = {Mutualistic networks are vital ecological and social systems shaped by adaptation and evolution. They involve bipartite cooperation via the exchange of goods or services between actors of different types. Empirical observations of mutualistic networks across genres and geographic conditions reveal correlated nested and modular patterns. Yet, the underlying mechanism for the network assembly remains unclear. We propose a niche-based adaptive mechanism where both nestedness and modularity emerge simultaneously as complementary facets of an optimal niche structure. Key dynamical properties are revealed at different timescales. Foremost, mutualism can either enhance or reduce the network stability, depending on competition intensity. Moreover, structural adaptations are asymmetric, exhibiting strong hysteresis in response to environmental change. Finally, at the evolutionary timescale we show that the adaptive mechanism plays a crucial role in preserving the distinctive patterns of mutualism under species invasions and extinctions.},

abstract = {Oscillator networks display intricate synchronization patterns. Determining their stability typically requires incorporating the symmetries of the network coupling. Going beyond analyses that appeal only to a network's automorphism group, we explore synchronization patterns that emerge from the phase-shift invariance of the dynamical equations and symmetries in the nodes. We show that these nonstructural symmetries simplify stability calculations. We analyze a ring-network of phase-amplitude oscillators that exhibits a "decoupled" state in which physically-coupled nodes appear to act independently due to emergent cancellations in the equations of dynamical evolution. We establish that this state can be linearly stable for a ring of phase-amplitude oscillators, but not for a ring of phase-only oscillators that otherwise require explicit long-range, nonpairwise, or nonphase coupling. In short, amplitude-phase interactions are key to stable synchronization at a distance.},

abstract = {For some time, it has been thought that backpropagation of errors could not be implemented in biophysiologically realistic neural circuits. This belief was largely due to either 1) the need for symmetric replication of feedback and feedforward weights, 2) the need for differing forms of activation between forward and backward propagating sweeps, and 3) the need for a separate network for error gradient computation and storage, on the one hand, or 4) nonphysiological backpropagation through the forward propagating neurons themselves, on the other. In this paper, we present spiking neuron mechanisms for gating pulses to maintain short-term memories, controlling forward inference and backward error propagation, and coordinating learning of feedback and feedforward weights. These neural mechanisms are synthesized into a new backpropagation algorithm for neuromorphic circuits.},

abstract = {Complex natural and engineered systems are ubiquitous, and their behavior is challenging to characterize and control. We examine the design of the entrainment process for an uncountably infinite collection of coupled phase oscillators that are all subject to the same periodic driving signal. In the absence of coupling, an appropriately designed input can result in each oscillator attaining the frequency of the driving signal, with a phase offset determined by its natural frequency. We consider a special case of interacting oscillators in which the coupling tends to destabilize the phase configuration to which the driving signal would send the collection in the absence of coupling. In this setting, we derive stability results that characterize the trade-off between the effects of driving and coupling, and compare these results to the well-known Kuramoto model of a collection of freerunning coupled oscillators.},
